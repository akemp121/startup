        <h3><i>Keep your foreign language proficiency afloat.</i></h3>

        <p>

            Many people who have learned foreign languages (RMs) struggle
            to find opportunities to practice. While the overall best way 
            to practice is speaking, other methods such as reading can provide
            a solid practice, especially with strengthening vocabulary.

        <p>

            This app will allow users to read about topics they find 
            interesting at a difficulty that pushes them to learn new words. 
            Once they've accumulated enough unknown words, they'll be able to
            memorize them and quiz themselves on what they've learned.

        </p>

        <p>

            The process of reading, translating, and memorizing helped me 
            immensely when learning Spanish and Q'eqchi'. My goal is to streamline 
            the process into a single, specialized app.
